In need of a BBQ chicken marinade? From easy spiced jerk, great for marinating ribs, to Asian chilli, ideal for salmon fillets and chicken thighs, give your BBQ meat, fish and veg a little extra oomph this summer with these punchy marinades. Marinate your chicken for several hours or overnight before grilling to allow the marinade to really soak into the meat. I like using zip lock bags to marinate any meat I plan on grilling. Just flip the bag over every hour or so to ensure all the meat gets marinated evenly.
