I used a fresh bag of washed and trimmed brussels sprouts that can be microwaved right in the bag. Remove from the heat and mix the brussels sprouts and ground beef together. Drizzle the sweet chili sauce over the top and stir until evenly coated. Our garden has been producing beautifully so far this year, but unfortunately the cabbage won&#39;t be ready until the cooler Fall weather sets in. This easy shaved Brussels sprouts salad sweetened with roasted beets and crunchy pecans is delicious as a healthy vegetarian main dish or served as a side.
